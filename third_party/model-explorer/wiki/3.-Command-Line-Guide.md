Model Explorer can be directly started from command line after you've successfully [installed](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/wiki/1.-Installation) it. Use `$model-explorer -h` to see the help for all the command line flags.

Here are some typical use cases:

# Start Model Explorer

The default command without any flags will start the Model Explorer local server at `http://localhost:8080` (or another free port if port 8080 is not available) and tries to open the web app automatically in a browser tab.

```
$ model-explorer
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the web app doesn't open automatically (e.g. in WSL), copy the url printed in terminal and paste it into browser to open it manually.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--host=0.0.0.0` to make the server accessible via public IP address. This is useful to access Model Explorer started on a remote machine.

# Start Model Explorer with a model

Use the following command to directly open a model file in Model Explorer. If the model is supported, it will be automatically processed and visualized in Model Explorer. You can also pass multiple model file paths separated by comma.

```
$ model-explorer /path/to/model/file
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use relative paths and paths with `~`.


# Start Model Explorer with a model and a custom node data file

See how custom node data works in the [user guide](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/wiki/2.-User-Guide#custom-node-data). You can pass multiple node data files separated by comma.

```
$ model-explorer /path/to/model/file --node_data_paths=/path/to/node_data.json
```
