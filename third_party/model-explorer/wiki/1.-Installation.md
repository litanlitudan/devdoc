Model Explorer supports Python 3.9 - 3.13 on major Linux distributions, WSL on Windows (with ubuntu 22.04), and macOS.
Follow the steps below to install it:

1.  Create a virtual environment (optional):

    ```
    $ mkdir <some_dir> && cd <some_dir>
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1.  Install package:

    On Mac
    ```bash
    $ pip install torch ai-edge-model-explorer
    ```

    On Linux or WSL, use the following command for a faster installation (by only installing PyTorch cpu package)
    ```bash
    $ pip install torch ai-edge-model-explorer \
        --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
        --extra-index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple
    ```

    ℹ️ You don't need to install `torch` if you don't want to use Model Explorer to visualize PyTorch models.

1.  Run from command line. The following command will start a server at `localhost:8080` and
    open the Model Explorer web app in a browser tab. See more info in the [Command line guide](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/wiki/3.-Command-Line-Guide)
    ```bash
    $ model-explorer
    ```
    > It might take up to 30 seconds when running it for the first time.
