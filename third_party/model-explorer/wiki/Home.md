Model Explorer is a powerful graph visualization tool
designed to help you understand and debug your ML models. Key features include:

*   **Hierarchical Layout**
   
    View your model's structure clearly with nested layers that you can expand and collapse as needed.

*   **Metadata Overlays**

    Gain insights by overlaying metadata (e.g., attributes, inputs/outputs, etc) and custom data (e.g. performance) on nodes.

*   **Powerful Interactive Features**

    Focus on specific areas with search, navigate graphs smoothly with bookmarks and layer popups,
    customize node styles with queries, compare graphs side-by-side, and more.
 
*   **Popular ML Framework Support**
    
    Works with popular ML formats like TensorFlow, JAX, TFLite, TensorFlow.js, MLIR, and PyTorch.

*   **Extension Support**

    Write your own extensions in Python to add support for more model formats.

*   **High Performance Rendering**

    Model Explorer uses custom WebGL shaders for GPU-accelerated rendering, effortlessly
    visualizing tens of thousands of nodes, edges, and labels, and ensuring a constant
    60 FPS for responsive user interaction.
