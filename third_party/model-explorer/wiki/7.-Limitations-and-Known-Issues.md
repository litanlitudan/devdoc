This page outlines current limitations and known issues in our project:

# Format support

## MLIR dialect support

We currently only support the following dialects for your MLIR file:
* TensorFlow (tf)
* TensorFlow Lite (tfl)
* StableHLO (stablehlo)

The list will expand in the future. You can also use our [Adapter Extension API](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/wiki/6.-Develop-Adapter-Extension) to build your own custom adapters. The example can be found [here](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/tree/main/src/example_adapters/my_adapter).

## PyTorch model support

We only support PyTorch models in ExportedProgram format. You can obtain the ExportedProgram through [torch.export.export](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/export.html).

The **recommended way** to visualize ExportedProgram is to use our [Python API](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/model-explorer/wiki/4.-API-Guide#visualize-pytorch-models) as it avoids the potential package version conflicts and you don't have to serialize your exported program into `.pt2` file.

However, you are also welcome to save it and upload it to UI by using
```
torch.export.save(exported_program, 'exported_program.pt2')
```

Note:
* ExportedProgram format is not stable and doesn't have API/schema stability.
* The PyTorch version used for exporting the model must match with the version of torch installed locally to ensure compatibility.
* The current adapter implementation supports `torch >= 2.2.0`. No compatibility guarantee for versions before `2.2.0`.

## JAX model support

Visualization of the original JAX model is not supported yet.

You need to export the JAX model either to a TF SavedModel or a StableHLO MLIR. Here is a [tutorial](https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo/blob/main/docs/tutorials/jax-export.ipynb) guiding you to set up with both approaches.

## Limited support for ops with unnamed nested regions

Some ops that generate unnamed nested regions might not contain all the op information, eg. `stablehlo.reduce_scatter`, `stablehlo.map`, `stablehlo.sort`, etc. They will be displayed in Model Explorer, but their nested regions might be missing for now.

# Platform support

## Windows support

Windows is supported exclusively through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Native Windows installations are not currently supported.

# Troubleshooting and feedback
